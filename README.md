I'm a graphic designer turned software engineer bridging my two favorite things together to make amazing websites. I am proficient in both frontend and backend development. I also have experience with web and UX design, so I can offer creative insight on a project. What drives my work is creating a thoughtfully designed product with great UX/UI.
